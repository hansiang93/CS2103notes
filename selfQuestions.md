## Revision Control

<details> 
  <summary> What is Revision Control? </summary>
   RC is the process of managing multiple version of information
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> What does a commit save?</summary>
  Committing saves a SNAPSHOT. Stage the change -> commit
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> Which RCS flow does not have branches?</summary>
  Centralised flow!

  There is a distributed RCS and centralised RCS. Distributed has multiple remotes that PR each other.

  Forking flow is what we did for CS2103, 1 main and everyone forks from there and PR back.

  Feature Branch Flow is 1 Main, with multiple branches inside with a feature each, and merges back to Main.

  Centralised Flow is this markdown form. Free For all.
