## Revision Control

<details> 
  <summary> What is Revision Control? </summary>
   A: RC is the process of managing multiple version of information
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> What does a commit save?</summary>
  A: Committing saves a SNAPSHOT of the tracked files. Stage the changes -> commit the changes.
</details>


<details> 
  <summary> What can RC help you with?</summary>
  Collaboration, recovering from mistakes, manage drift between multiple versions of project, detect incompatible changes to the same file.
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> Which RCS flow does not have branches?</summary>
  A: Centralised flow!

  There is a distributed RCS and centralised RCS. Distributed has multiple remotes that PR each other.

  Forking flow is what we did for CS2103, 1 main and everyone forks from there and PR back.

  Feature Branch Flow is 1 Main, with multiple branches inside with a feature each, and merges back to Main.

  Centralised Flow is this markdown form. Free For all.

  üëé By inserting temporary print statements

  üëé By manually tracing through the code

  üëç Using a debugger
  Allows for step wise running of code in real time

</details>

## Testing

<details>
  <summary>How does the Singleton pattern affect the testability of a Java application? </summary>
  A: Singletons reduce testability due to these reasons: 
  
  * They create implicit dependencies that are hard to replace using dependency injection because Java doesn‚Äôt allow overriding of static members. 
  
  * Singleton object represents a global ‚Äòstate‚Äô. If the state of the Singleton affects the test case execution, then the Singleton object needs to be ‚Äòreset‚Äô at the beginning of each test case.

#### Project Management




#### Testing

<details> 
  <summary> Testing how easy it is to use a software is a form of Integration Testing</summary>
  Answer: False

  this is a form of System testing
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> When a developer tests a SUT, it is called Developer Testing</summary>
  Answer: True

  this is to start testing as early as possible, before a full product is released.
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> Scripted testing is better than exploratory testing</summary>
  Answer: False

  A mix of both is better than either.
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> A test driver is a person that tests the SUT for the purpose of testing</summary>
  Answer: False

  A test driver is the code that ‚Äòdrives‚Äô the SUT for the purpose of testing
</details>

<details> 
  <summary> A stub can be used to inject into an object for the purpose of testing in islation</summary>
  Answer: True

  Dependency injection is the process of 'injecting' objects to replace current dependencies with a different object. This is often used to inject stubs to isolate the SUT from its dependencies so that it can be tested in isolation.
